# Machine Learning based Car prjce predictions

This repository is about my final project at my Data Science Bootcamp at WBS Coding School. This main components of this repository are:

1. the Jupyter Notebook, where the process from dataset to trained ML model is described
2. the WebApp based on streamlit, where the ML model is implemented and used 
3. a Car Database, with all its car models with all its configurations listed, 


Besides that, I think the information written in the notebook is somewhat self-explanatory.
